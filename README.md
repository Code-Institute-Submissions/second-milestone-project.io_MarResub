## WELCOME TO ROMANIA
Welcome to Romania is a website that displays the tourist attraction potential of Romania."Romania is the 12th largest country in Europe and "the 7th most populous state of the Europian Union" EU.

 
## UX
This website tends to showcase great tourism attraction places in Romania, most people from the very far end of the continent. Some people in the faraway continent only see Romania on the Map, as well as on the news. I am willing to create more awareness on sightseeing and attractions Romania has to offer.

 
## Features
The Home Page
This is Section is considered as the landing page,
It shows 12 tourist attraction centres

 
It also portrays four tourists who give their feedback on how they enjoyed various sightseeing.

 
At the footer, there are some social media networks.

 
## Future Improvements

I will have to add some modal to explain and give more details of the destination.
I will have to optimise the website to stand out among its competitors.

 
## The Technologies I have used
HTML W3Schools, for adhering to the correct HTML syntax
CSS W3Schools for adhering to the correct CSS syntax
Icons Font Awesome used in the project via downloads
fonts.googleapis.com from google developers imbedded into my project
I used this JS programming for creating some logic to the project work as well as the client-side and server-side that could allow some interaction.  

 
## Validators
I used HTML  [W3C Validator] (https://validator.w3.org/)
and CSS [W3C Validator] (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
to validate the web document. 
When examing the web content with the HTML and CSS Validator, It displayed some errors in general, I then took a thorough look and corrected the errors.

 
## Testing
As a tourist, I would be glad to visit and browse to a landing page that is not difficult to navigate.

Being a customer I will like to see and know what it entails to visit a new destination before going there.
Links to the social media network is provided so that the tourist could find out more details about their intended destinations.
The logo which is the Romanian flag is displayed with the country's name for easy identification. 

 
## Manual Testing
Home Page
This is the Index page, more so, the landing page once entered it takes the user to all the necessary details or the various tourist destinations.

## Header Section
It contains the names of different sections of the pages, navbars, a welcome note is all boldly written out and the Logo name countries flag.

## Romain section
This tends to show the tourist attractions

 
## Card Section
This portrays as their necessary information cost for entrance to these tourist locations.

 
## Footer Section 
To confirm social media icons are working at the footer click on the various icons to see its functions. It contains the name of the company and the designer of the website.

 
The website is working well and I am still studying the grid system and Modal to input it effectively for accurate responsiveness.

 
## Bugs
I tried to insect bootstrap Modal, but it created a bug in the entire website. so I will have to devote some more time to study the Bootstrap Modal. 

I noticed that when I open the website on a window explorer the website is not responsive as intended, despite trying all efforts. 

 
## Deployment
Deploying the GitHub Pages from my Desktop
Log into GitHub.
I will have to create a repository which is
 Sampatbraide/second-milestone-project.github.io
after doing that I will upload my project to the repository
this will take a couple of minutes.

 
Moreso I can also use
[MAKE A README](https://https://www.makeareadme.com/)
Type the document format it and transfer it to [GITHUB](http://github.com//)
Then I can examine it a re-test by ensuring that everything is working as expected.
