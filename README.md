   such as the About us, Culture, About us and Attractions for a better UI. 
 * I will have to add some modal to explain and give more details of the destination.
 * I will optimise the website by adding a live google map where users can view attraction locations.
   interactivity and usability of the website.

 ## The Technologies I have used
 [HTML W3Schools](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)  for adhering to the correct  HTML syntax
 [CSS W3Schools](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) for adhering to the correct  CSS syntax
 [Icons Font Awesome](https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/css/all.css"/) used in the project via downloads
 [FONT](fonts.googleapis.com/) from google developers embedded into my project
 I used this JS programming for creating some logic to the project work.


 ## Validators

 I used HTML  [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)Â   
 [CSS W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  to validate the web documents. 
 When examining the web content with the HTML and CSS Validator, It displayed some errors in general, I then took a thorough look and corrected the errors.

 ## Testing user Stories
 
 * As a user I shall be glad to know about previous feedbacks.
 * As a tourist I will be glad to know all the potentials it can offer.
 * As a tourist I will be glad to know the weather conditions before embarking on a journey.  
 * As a tourist, I would be glad to visit and browse to a landing page that is not difficult to navigate.


 Being a customer  I will like to see and know what it entails to visit a new destination before going there.
 Links to the social media network is provided so that the tourist could find out more details about their intended destinations.
 The logo which is the Romanian flag is displayed with the country's name for easy identification. 

 # Home Page
 This is the Index page, more so, the landing page once entered it takes the user to all the necessary details or the various tourist destinations.

 ## Header Section
 It contains the names of different sections of the pages,  navbars, a welcome note is all boldly written out and the Logo is Romania's flag.

 ## Romanian section
 This tends to show the tourist attractions in various columns.

 ## Card Section
 This portrays as their necessary information cost for entrance to these tourist locations.

 ## Footer Section 
 To confirm social media icons are working at the footer click on the various icons to see their functions. It contains the name of the company and the designer of the website.

 The website is working well and I am still studying the grid system and Modal to input it effectively for accurate responsiveness.

 ## Bugs
 I tried to insect bootstrap Modal, but it created a bug in the entire website. so I will have to devote some more time to study and work on the Bootstrap Modal.  

 ## Deployment
 Deploying the GitHub Pages from my Desktop
 Log into GitHub.
 I will have to create a repository that is
 [WELCOME TO ROMANIA](https://sampatbraide.github.io/second-milestone-project.io/)
 after doing that I will upload my project to the repository
 this will take a couple of minutes.

 Moreso, I can also use
 [MAKE A README](https://https://www.makeareadme.com/)
 Type the document in the correct format, format it and then transfer it to [GITHUB](http://github.com/)
 Then I can examine it a re-test by ensuring that everything is working as expected.
